            # Command Injection Runbook
            
            Command injection is a malicious technique where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject and execute arbitrary operating system (OS) commands on the server. By manipulating input data, attackers can manipulate the application's execution flow, tricking it into running unintended system commands.This can result in data breaches, system compromise, etc. Contrast uses various detection capabilities for Command Injection. Some track malicious input into commands being run, some detect sensitive file paths being accessed, and so forth.\s

            \\
            What is the “outcome” of the event you are triaging? (click to proceed) \s

            - [Blocked](#blocked)
            
            - [Ineffective](#ineffective)
            - [Success](#success)
            
            
            ## Exploited
            
            "Exploited" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like command injection and then confirmed the input performed a command injection during a call to the operating system by observing the execution of the injected command and its effects on the system. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - Does a system command get run in the application as part of normal usage?
            - Are there command chaining operators present? (&& || ; & |)
            - Are there command substitution characters present? ($(), ``)
            - Do the commands seem to be accessing suspicious files? (/etc/password/)
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there unusual os/system related messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            - Are there application logs with OS error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `original_cmd_by_server $(cat /etc/passwd)`
            - `original_cmd_by_server; command2`
            - `original_cmd_by_server && command2`
            - `original_cmd_by_server || command2` \s
            
            \\
            Does the event appear to be a true positive? (click to proceed) \s
            
            - [No](#exploited-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#exploited-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like command injection and then confirmed the input performed a command injection during a call to the operating system and therefore blocked the execution of it. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Does a system command get run in the application as part of normal usage?
            - Are there command chaining operators present? (&& || ; & |)
            - Are there command substitution characters present? ($(), ``)
            - Do the commands seem to be accessing suspicious files? (/etc/password/)
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there unusual os/system related messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            - Are there application logs with OS error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `original_cmd_by_server $(cat /etc/passwd)`
            - `original_cmd_by_server; command2`
            - `original_cmd_by_server && command2`
            - `original_cmd_by_server || command2` \s
            
            
            \\
            Is the event a true positive? (click to proceed)
            
            - [No](#blocked-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#blocked-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            
            
            
            ## Ineffective
            
            "Ineffective" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like command injection, but did not confirm the input performed a command injection during execution. This is called a “Probe” within the Contrast UI. This event is an unsuccessful attempt at an exploit. They can indicate an attack fuzzing and looking for vulnerabilities.
            
            - Does the probe event appear to be caused by legitimate traffic and numerous similar probe events are being generated, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured to clean up Contrast data. \s
            - Is the probe originating from a specific ip[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?   Consider… \s
              - Block using network appliance
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html)
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account \s
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            [Proceed to Post-Incident Activities](#post-incident-activities) \s
            
            
            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s
            
            \\
            [Proceed to Post-Incident Activities](#post-incident-activities) \s
            
            
            ## Exploited True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive). \s
            
            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html) \s
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be [switched to “Block” mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s
            
            \\
            \\
            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            ## Exploited False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore
            - [Create Exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html)
            
            \\
            [Proceed to Post-Incident Activities](#post-incident-activities) \s
        
            ## Blocked True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application’s design relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive).
            
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - payload
              - Stack trace of the request \s
            - Look for IOCs of further attacks in other parts/inputs of the application
              - Other blocked or probed events? \s
              - Did anything show up as "exploited" indicating a different rule did not have blocking enabled?
            - Ignore
            
            [Proceed to Post-Incident Activities](#post-incident-activities) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, then Contrast may be blocking legitimate usage of the application, therefore negatively impacting it.
            
            - Create an exclusion to allow the legitimate traffic through so that you can continue to be protected by “Block” mode without the negative impact.
            - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows legitimate traffic through and any non-matches (attack traffic) will be blocked. \s
            - If neither of the above options are satisfactory and the negative impact of the application must be avoided, you can switch the rule to “Monitor” mode.

            ## Benign True Positive
            
            To review, a Benign True Positive occurs when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. Consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore
            - Create Exclusion \s
            - Work with the application developer on alternative implementations that do not pose such risk to the application, but meets the business needs.
            
            ## Post-Incident Activities
            
            - **Documentation**
              - **Incident Report:** Document the incident, including findings, raw events and alerts, actions taken, assets impacted, and lessons learned.
              - **Update Documentation:** Keep security runbooks and documentation up to date.
            - **Communication**
              - **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident and steps taken.
              - **User Notification:** Notify affected users if there was a data breach.
            - **Review and Improve**
              - **Review Response:** Conduct a post-mortem to review the response and identify improvement areas.
              - **Enhance Security Posture:** Implement additional security measures and improve monitoring. \s
            ## Handling Process Hardening \s
            
            Process Hardening refers to a block that the agent applies to the application to be able to start external processes. Most web applications have no reason to launch external processes so this rule is intended to ensure that no attempts are made by an application to do so.
            
            When triaging this event type the key is in understanding if the web application starts external processes under normal conditions.
            
            Choose the Appropriate Action: \s
            If the application should NOT start external processes:
            - Enable Block Mode: This will prevent the application from launching any external processes, ensuring maximum security. \s
            
            \\
            If the application DOES need to start external processes:
            
            - Monitor Mode (Recommended): Start with monitor mode to observe the commands the application executes. This helps identify legitimate use cases and potential risks without disrupting normal functionality.
            - Exclusions: If monitoring reveals legitimate needs, configure an exclusion to allow only specific, trusted external processes to run. Once all legitimate executions are accounted for, the rule can be placed into Block mode.
            - Disable the Rule (Use with Caution): If the application requires external process execution and other options are not feasible consider disabling the rule.

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into websites viewed by other users. Instead of the website displaying trusted content, the attacker's code is executed, which can compromise user accounts, steal sensitive data, or even take control of the user's browser.

            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like a cross-site scripting attack and subsequently blocked it.  \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Are HTML tags included in the payload? (<>,  </>)
            - Are suspicious HTML attributes present in the payload? (onerror, onload, onfocus, etc)
            - Look for any suspicious protocols within the payload, such as javascript: or data:.
            - Are there application logs with relevant error messages?

            ## Suspicious
            
            "Suspicious" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like a cross-site scripting payload. Contrast reports suspicious for non-input tracing rules where Contrast is unable to verify that an attack occurred, and the rule is in monitor mode. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Are HTML tags included in the payload? (<>,  </>)
            - Are suspicious HTML attributes present in the payload? (onerror, onload, onfocus, etc)
            - Look for any suspicious protocols within the payload, such as javascript: or data:.
            - Are there application logs with relevant error messages?
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
            - `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
            - `<a href='javascript:alert(1)'>Click me</a>`

            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s

            ## Suspicious True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive). \s
            
            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html)
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be switched to “Block” mode which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s
            
            \\
            \\
            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            ## Suspicious False Positive

            ## Blocked True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application’s design relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive).
            
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - payload
              - Stack trace of the request \s
            - Look for IOCs of further attacks in other parts/inputs of the application
              - Other blocked or probed events? \s
              - Did anything show up as "exploited" indicating a different rule did not have blocking enabled?
            - Ignore
            
            [Proceed to Post-Incident Activities](#post-incident-activities) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, then Contrast may be blocking legitimate usage of the application, therefore negatively impacting it.
            
            - Create an exclusion to allow the legitimate traffic through so that you can continue to be protected by “Block” mode without the negative impact.
            - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows legitimate traffic through and any non-matches (attack traffic) will be blocked. \s
            - If neither of the above options are satisfactory and the negative impact of the application must be avoided, you can switch the rule to “Monitor” mode.

            ## Benign True Positive
            
            To review, a Benign True Positive occurs when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. Consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore
            - Create Exclusion \s
            - Work with the application developer on alternative implementations that do not pose such risk to the application, but meets the business needs.

            # Expression Language Injection Runbook
            
            Expression Language Injection works by taking advantage of server-side code injection vulnerabilities which occur whenever an application incorporates user-controllable data into a string that is dynamically evaluated by a code interpreter. This can lead to complete compromise of the application's data and functionality, as well as the server that is hosting the application.

            ## Exploited
            
            An "Exploited" outcome indicates that Contrast detected an input entering an application that resembled Expression Language Injection. It then confirmed that this input was utilized in the evaluation of the expression language. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - Does the payload contain references to Java classes or methods?
            - Does the payload contain os commands?
            - Does the payload contain template engine expressions? (e.g. ${...}, #{...}, *{...})
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there application logs with template engine related error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("whoami")`
            - `${pageContext.request.getSession().setAttribute("admin",true)}`
            - `*{T(org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils).toString(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('id').getInputStream())}` \s

            - [Yes, or unsure](#exploited-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked
            
            A "Blocked" outcome indicates that Contrast detected an input entering an application that resembled Expression Language Injection. It then confirmed that this input was going to be evaluated by the expression language and therefore blocked it. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Does the payload contain references to Java classes or methods?
            - Does the payload contain os commands?
            - Does the payload contain template engine expressions? (e.g. ${...}, #{...}, *{...})
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there application logs with template engine related error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("whoami")`
            - `${pageContext.request.getSession().setAttribute("admin",true)}`

            ## Ineffective
            
            "Ineffective" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like Expression Language injection, but did not confirm that the input was used evaluated by the expression template engine. This is called a “Probe” within the Contrast UI. This event is a real attack attempt to exploit your application, but it was ineffective. Probes can indicate an attacker scanning or exploring for vulnerabilities.
            
            - Does the probe event appear to be caused by legitimate traffic and numerous similar probe events are being generated, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured to clean up Contrast data. \s

            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s

            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):

            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s

            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s

            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s

            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc

              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign.

            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s

            Method Tampering (aka verb tampering or HTTP method tampering) is an attack where an attacker manipulates the HTTP method used in a request to a web application. Providing unexpected HTTP methods can sometimes bypass authentication, authorization or other security mechanisms.

            ## Exploited
            
            "Exploited" means Contrast detected an abnormal HTTP method used in an incoming request, and the response code was not a 501 or 405 indicating the request was processed. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s

            - Is the HTTP response code not a 501 or 405?
            - Does the HTTP method make sense in the context of the application? (e.g a DELETE request to a static resource)

            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" means Contrast detected an abnormal HTTP method used in an incoming request, therefore blocked execution of the request. \s

            JNDI injection is a malicious technique where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to influence the server used in a JNDI lookup. Where an attacker can influence the server the JNDI Lookup is sent to, it is possible to get the server to connect to a malicious JNDI Server which returns a malicious class which when loaded will give the attacker Remote Code Execution on the impacted server. Also in the case of infamous log4shell vulnerability, as well as RCE, it is possible to exfiltrate data fro the impacted server.

            - [Success](#success)
            
            ## Exploited
            
            An "Exploited" outcome means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that is then used to create a JNDI Query with the protocol RMI or LDAP. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - An unknown LDAP or RMI Server.

            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `jndi:ldap://example.com:1389/jdk8`
            - `jndi:rmi://example.com:1389/jdk8`
            - `jndi:ldap://${env:USER}.${env:USERNAME}.example.com:1389/` \s

            - [No](#exploited-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#exploited-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" outcome means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that is then used to create a JNDI Query with the protocol RMI or LDAP and Contrast stopped the Query from executing. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
           
            - An unknown LDAP or RMI Server.

            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `jndi:ldap://example.com:1389/jdk8`
            - `jndi:rmi://example.com:1389/jdk8`
            - `jndi:ldap://${env:USER}.${env:USERNAME}.example.com:1389/` \s

            \\
            Is the event a true positive? (click to proceed)
            
            - [No](#blocked-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#blocked-true-positive) \s

            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s

            ## Exploited True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s

            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html) \s
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be [switched to “Block” mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s

            Path traversal attacks use an affected application to gain unauthorized access to server file system folders that are higher in the directory hierarchy than the web root folder. A successful path traversal attack can fool a web application into reading and consequently exposing the contents of files outside of the document root directory of the application or the web server, including credentials for back-end systems, application code and data, and sensitive operating system files. If successful this can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, and remote code execution.

            ## Exploited
            
            An "Exploited" outcome means Contrast detected an input resembling a Path Traversal attack that reached a vulnerable file operation, and then successfully manipulated that operation to access a file outside the intended directory. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - Are there plain or encoded path traversal sequences present? (../, %2e%2e%2f)
            - Are suspicious files or paths being requested? (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, c:\\windows\\system32\\, etc)
            - Are any known file security bypasses present in the file path? (::$DATA, ::$Index, (null byte))
            - Are unexpected files present in the filesystem?
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there application logs with file operation related error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `../../../etc/passwd`
            - `%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd`
            - `\\../\\../\\etc/\\password`
            - `..0x2f..0x2fetc0x2fpasswd` \s
            
            \\
            Does the event appear to be a true positive? (click to proceed) \s
            
            - [No](#exploited-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#exploited-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" means Contrast detected an input resembling a Path Traversal attack that reached a vulnerable file operation, and therefore blocked the application from performing the operation \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Are there plain or encoded path traversal sequences present? (../, %2e%2e%2f)
            - Are suspicious files or paths being requested? (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, c:\\windows\\system32\\, etc)
            - Are any known file security bypasses present in the file path? (::$DATA, ::$Index, (null byte))
            - Are unexpected files present in the filesystem?
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there application logs with file operation related error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `../../../etc/passwd`
            - `%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd`
            - `\\../\\../\\etc/\\password`
            - `..0x2f..0x2fetc0x2fpasswd` \s
            
            
            \\
            Is the event a true positive? (click to proceed)
            
            - [No](#blocked-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#blocked-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            
            
            
            ## Ineffective
            
            "Ineffective" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like Path Traversal, but did not confirm that the input was used in a file operation. This is called a “Probe” within the Contrast UI. This event is a real attack attempt to exploit your application, but it was ineffective. Probes can indicate an attacker scanning or exploring for vulnerabilities.
            
            - Does the probe event appear to be caused by legitimate traffic and numerous similar probe events are being generated, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured to clean up Contrast data. \s
            - Is the probe originating from a specific ip[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?   Consider… \s
              - Block using network appliance
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html)
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account \s
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account

            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s
            
            \\
            [Proceed to Post-Incident Activities](#post-incident-activities) \s
            
            
            ## Exploited True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive). \s
            
            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html) \s
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be [switched to “Block” mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s
            
            \\
            \\
            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            ## Blocked True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application’s design relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive).
            
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - payload
              - Stack trace of the request \s
            - Look for IOCs of further attacks in other parts/inputs of the application
              - Other blocked or probed events? \s
              - Did anything show up as "exploited" indicating a different rule did not have blocking enabled?
            - Ignore

            ## Blocked False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, then Contrast may be blocking legitimate usage of the application, therefore negatively impacting it.
            
            - Create an exclusion to allow the legitimate traffic through so that you can continue to be protected by “Block” mode without the negative impact.
            - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows legitimate traffic through and any non-matches (attack traffic) will be blocked. \s
            - If neither of the above options are satisfactory and the negative impact of the application must be avoided, you can switch the rule to “Monitor” mode.

            To review, a Benign True Positive occurs when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. Consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore
            - Create Exclusion \s

            # SQL Injection Runbook
            
            SQL injection is a malicious technique where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject unauthorized SQL commands into the database. By carefully crafting input data, attackers can manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even complete database compromise.

            ## Exploited
            
            An "Exploited" outcome means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like SQL injection, and then confirmed the input was used in a SQL query that modified the meaning of that query. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - Are there SQL Keywords (JOIN, UNION, DROP, SELECT, AND, OR, SLEEP, etc) that change the logic of the query?
            - Are there SQL tautologies (1=1, ‘test’=’test’, and so on) that may change the boolean logic of an AND or OR statement?
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there SQL comments that comment-out parts of the query?
            - Are there unusual query execution times or error messages related to SQL around the same timestamp as the event?
            - Are there application logs with SQL error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `DROP sampletable;--`
            - `' or 1=1--`
            - `' UNION SELECT 1, 'anotheruser', 'doesnt matter', 1–`
            - `?id=1 AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT NAME_CONST(database(),1),NAME_CONST(database(),1)) as x)--`

            Does the event appear to be a true positive? (click to proceed) \s
            
            - [No](#exploited-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#exploited-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like SQL injection and then confirmed the input was used in a SQL query and modified the meaning of that query, and therefore blocked the application from performing the query. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Are there SQL Keywords (JOIN, UNION, DROP, SELECT, AND, OR, SLEEP, etc) that change the logic of the query?
            - Are there SQL tautologies (1=1, ‘test’=’test’, and so on) that may change the boolean logic of an AND or OR statement?
            - Is the IP address from a pentester or known vulnerability scanner IP?
            - Are there SQL comments that comment-out parts of the query?
            - Are there unusual query execution times or error messages related to SQL around the same timestamp as the event?
            - Are there application logs with SQL error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `DROP sampletable;--`
            - `' or 1=1--`
            - `' UNION SELECT 1, 'anotheruser', 'doesnt matter', 1–`
            - `?id=1 AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT NAME_CONST(database(),1),NAME_CONST(database(),1)) as x)--`
            - `select load_file('\\\\error\\abc');`
            - `?id=1 OR IF(MID(@@version,1,1)='5',sleep(1),1)='2'` \s
            
            
            \\
            Is the event a true positive? (click to proceed)
            
            - [No](#blocked-false-positive) \s
            - [Yes, or unsure](#blocked-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            
            
            
            ## Ineffective
            
            "Ineffective" means Contrast detected an input coming into an application that looked like SQL injection, but did not confirm that the input was used in a SQL query and modified the meaning of that query.. This is called a “Probe” within the Contrast UI. This event is a real attack attempt to exploit your application, but it was ineffective. Probes can indicate an attacker scanning or exploring for vulnerabilities.
            
            - Does the probe event appear to be caused by legitimate traffic and numerous similar probe events are being generated, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured to clean up Contrast data. \s
            - Is the probe originating from a specific ip[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?   Consider… \s
              - Block using network appliance
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html)
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account \s

              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account

            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s

            ## Exploited True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive). \s
            
            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html) \s
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be [switched to “Block” mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s
            
            \\
            \\
            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            ## Blocked True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application’s design relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive).
            
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - payload
              - Stack trace of the request \s
            - Look for IOCs of further attacks in other parts/inputs of the application
              - Other blocked or probed events? \s
              - Did anything show up as "exploited" indicating a different rule did not have blocking enabled?
            - Ignore

            ## Blocked False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, then Contrast may be blocking legitimate usage of the application, therefore negatively impacting it.
            
            - Create an exclusion to allow the legitimate traffic through so that you can continue to be protected by “Block” mode without the negative impact.
            - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows legitimate traffic through and any non-matches (attack traffic) will be blocked. \s
            - If neither of the above options are satisfactory and the negative impact of the application must be avoided, you can switch the rule to “Monitor” mode.

            To review, a Benign True Positive occurs when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. Consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore

            Serialization refers to the process of converting an object into a format which can be saved to a file or a datastore. Deserialization reverses this process, transforming serialized data coming from a file, stream, or network socket into an object.Untrusted Deserialization is a web application vulnerability that enables attackers to pass arbitrary objects or code to a deserializer. In this kind of attack, untrusted data abuses the logic of an application to inflict a denial of service (DoS) attack, achieve authentication bypass, enable remote code execution, and even execute arbitrary code as it is being deserialized.

            ## Exploited
            
            "Exploited" means Contrast detected serialized input coming into the application and then confirmed it was subsequently deserialized and contained a known vulnerable gadget token, or an operating system command was executed as part of the deserialization process. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - Did the application deserialize data from user controllable input?
            - Does the payload contain a [known gadget](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial)?
            - Does the decoded payload look like a binary object?
            - Does the payload represent a Java serialized object? (It should start with 'rO0AB')
            - Does the payload represent a .NET serialized object? (It should start with 'AAEAAAD')
            - Are there application logs with serialization error messages around the same timestamp as the event?

            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" means Contrast detected serialized input coming into the application and then confirmed it was being deserialized with a known vulnerable gadget token and therefore blocked the execution of it. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:

            "Ineffective" means that Contrast detected an input resembling a serialized string but did not confirm it was deserialized unsafely. This is called a “Probe” within the Contrast UI. This event is an unsuccessful attempt at an exploit. They can indicate an attack fuzzing and looking for vulnerabilities.
            
            - Does the probe event appear to be caused by legitimate traffic and numerous similar probe events are being generated, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured to clean up Contrast data. \s
            - Is the probe originating from a specific ip[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?   Consider… \s

            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s

            ## Exploited True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive). \s
            
            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html) \s
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be [switched to “Block” mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s

            \\
            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            ## Blocked True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application’s design relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive).
            
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - payload
              - Stack trace of the request \s
            - Look for IOCs of further attacks in other parts/inputs of the application
              - Other blocked or probed events? \s
              - Did anything show up as "exploited" indicating a different rule did not have blocking enabled?
            - Ignore

            ## Blocked False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, then Contrast may be blocking legitimate usage of the application, therefore negatively impacting it.
            
            - Create an exclusion to allow the legitimate traffic through so that you can continue to be protected by “Block” mode without the negative impact.
            - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows legitimate traffic through and any non-matches (attack traffic) will be blocked. \s
            - If neither of the above options are satisfactory and the negative impact of the application must be avoided, you can switch the rule to “Monitor” mode.

            ## Exploited
            
            "Exploited" indicates that Contrast detected an incoming input resembling an XML string containing external entities and then confirmed the declared entities were resolved by the XML parser. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event for common indicators: \s
            
            - Are entity declaration keywords present in the payload? (<!ENTITY, SYSTEM, PUBLIC, etc)
            - Are there references to external entities in the payload? (&example;)
            - Are there references to local files in the payload? (file:///, /etc/passwd, etc)
            - Are there references to remote files in the payload? (http://, https://, etc)
            - Are there application logs with XML parsing error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            
            \\

            - [Yes, or unsure](#exploited-true-positive) \s
            
            
            
            ## Blocked
            
            "Blocked" indicates that Contrast detected an incoming input resembling an XML string containing external entities and then confirmed the declared entities were being resolved by the XML parser and therefore blocked the application from performing the operation. \s
            
            To verify this is a true positive, review the following attributes of the event:
            
            - Are entity declaration keywords present in the payload? (<!ENTITY, SYSTEM, PUBLIC, etc)
            - Are there references to external entities in the payload? (&example;)
            - Are there references to local files in the payload? (file:///, /etc/passwd, etc)
            - Are there references to remote files in the payload? (http://, https://, etc)
            - Are there application logs with XML parsing error messages around the same timestamp as the event?
            
            
            \\
            Examples:
            
            - `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM "/etc/passwd"> ]><data>&example;</data>`

            ## Ineffective
            
            "Ineffective" means that Contrast detected an incoming input resembling an XML external entity injection, but it did not confirm that the entities were resolved. This is called a “Probe” within the Contrast UI. This event is a real attack attempt to exploit your application, but it was ineffective. Probes can indicate an attacker scanning or exploring for vulnerabilities.
            
            - Does the probe event appear to be caused by legitimate traffic and numerous similar probe events are being generated, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured to clean up Contrast data. \s
            - Is the probe originating from a specific ip[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?   Consider… \s
              - Block using network appliance

              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account

            ## Success
            
            “Success" means that Contrast's security measures functioned as intended, preventing unauthorized access or potentially malicious activity from reaching the application. This could be due to a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html), [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html), or [bot block rule](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.) being triggered. \s
            
            Generally, these events don't necessitate action because they signify the system is working correctly. \s
            
            However, further investigation may be beneficial in specific scenarios to gain more insights or proactively enhance security:
            
            - Should the event have been blocked?:
              - If the event is from an [IP block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/block-or-allow-ips.html):
                - Correlate the IP address with other events to identify any attempted malicious actions.
                - Look up the IP address's reputation and origin to determine if it's known for malicious activity.
                - Check if the IP is listed on any other denylists across your systems.
              - If the event is from a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html):
                - Correlate the event with any exploited or probed events.
                - Confirm if the virtual patch is protecting a known vulnerability in the application.
              - If the event is from a [Bot Block](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/server-configuration.html#:~:text=Bot%20blocking%20blocks%20traffic%20from,Events%2C%20use%20the%20filter%20options.):
                - Analyze the user-agent header of the HTTP request. Only requests originating from known scanning, fuzzing, or malicious user-agents should be blocked.
            
            \\
            If the event appears to be for legitimate traffic, an [exclusion](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-exclusions.html) can be configured. \s

            ## Exploited True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but is benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive). \s
            
            \\
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, the most immediate action to stop an "active" attack would be to block the current attacker of the exploited event, while further triage could result in a [virtual patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html)/[enabling block mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) for the rule: \s
            
            - Is the attack originating from a specific IP[s] that is a real external IP address (not internal load balancer or network device) and not the public IP address for a large company network?
              - Block using network appliance \s
              - [Block using Contrast](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/ip-management.html) \s
            - Are all of the events originating from the same application user account?
              - Determine if the account is a legitimate account \s
              - If so, attempt to help them recover the account by contacting and authenticating the legitimate user, arranging to change their credentials, and recover from any damage.
              - If not,  consider the following options:
                - Ban the account
                - Disable the account
                - Delete the account
            
            \\
            \\
            Once the current attack has been stopped, consider taking additional steps to prevent future exploitation. \s
            
            - If the only “Exploited” events for this rule are true positives, then the rule can be [switched to “Block” mode](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/set-protect-rules.html) which will prevent future exploitation. \s
            - If there are other “Exploited” events that appear to be legitimate, benign traffic, then “Block” mode would block those events as well, which could have negative impact to the application. \s
              - Before enabling “Block” mode for this situation, you must first exclude the legitimate, benign traffic being caught in the rule. \s
              - Alternatively, you can set up a [Virtual Patch](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/virtual-patches.html) that only allows the legitimate, benign traffic through and any non-matches will be blocked.
            
            If none of the above options are satisfactory and it's perceived the application is at great risk, you can consider shutting down the application or removing network connectivity. \s
            
            \\
            \\
            Post Containment
            
            - If confirmed this is a True Positive, it should be raised with the appsec/dev teams to get fixed. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
            
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - Attack payload
              - Stack trace of the request
            - To better understand the extent of the incident and to ensure the attack is no longer occurring, look for other IOCs:
              - Did the same IP Address Generate Other Alerts?
              - Is the vulnerability being exploited by other actors?
              - Spike in traffic or repeated access patterns to the vulnerable URL
              - Correlate exploited events with any "probed" or "blocked" events
              - If the attack was able to execute commands on the server, the server may need to be considered compromised and reviewed for persistence and other lateral movement.

            ## Exploited False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore

            ## Blocked True Positive \s
            
            It is possible that the event is a True Positive, but benign. A Benign True Positive is when an application’s design relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. This determination will often require the assistance of the development or application security teams. \s
            
            If the event appears to be a Benign True Positive, click [here](#benign-true-positive).
            
            If it does not appear to be a Benign True Positive, consider the following options:
            
            - If one IP address is generating a lot of blocked events, it's probably worthwhile to block it. \s
            - Notify Dev/Appsec team of Vulnerability. Useful information for those teams would be: \s
              - Application name
              - Is app in production, development, staging, etc
              - Affected URL
              - payload
              - Stack trace of the request \s
            - Look for IOCs of further attacks in other parts/inputs of the application
              - Other blocked or probed events? \s
              - Did anything show up as "exploited" indicating a different rule did not have blocking enabled?
            - Ignore

            ## Blocked False Positive \s
            
            If the event seems to be a False Positive, then Contrast may be blocking legitimate usage of the application, therefore negatively impacting it.
            
            - Create an exclusion to allow the legitimate traffic through so that you can continue to be protected by “Block” mode without the negative impact.
            - Alternatively, you can set up a Virtual Patch that only allows legitimate traffic through and any non-matches (attack traffic) will be blocked. \s
            - If neither of the above options are satisfactory and the negative impact of the application must be avoided, you can switch the rule to “Monitor” mode.

            ## Benign True Positive
            
            To review, a Benign True Positive occurs when an application relies on vulnerable behavior that could potentially be exploited, but is currently necessary for operation. Consider the following options:
            
            - Ignore
            - Create Exclusion \s
            - Work with the application developer on alternative implementations that do not pose such risk to the application, but meets the business needs.
